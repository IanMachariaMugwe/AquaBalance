Technology Stack  

- Frontend: Kotlin for Android development.  
- Backend: Firebase Firestore for real-time database and Retrofit for API integration.  
- Maps: Google Maps SDK for location and navigation features.  
- Authentication: Firebase Authentication for secure login and sign-up.

App Architecture  

AquaBalance follows the *MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)* architecture to maintain clean and scalable code.  

1. Model: Handles data operations and communicates with the Firestore database.  
2. View: The UI components of the app for users and authorities.  
3. ViewModel: Manages app logic and acts as a bridge between the Model and View.
